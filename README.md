### How to run locally

This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4.5+ to run.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ben198/developer-test.git
$ cd developer-test
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your web browser should open automatically and load http://localhost:8080/ in a new tab

To build this app I used the following tools:
- React
- Express
- Gulp
- Webpack
- Babel
- Qwest (ajax library)
